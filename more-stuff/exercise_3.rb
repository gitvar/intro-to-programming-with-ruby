# Question: What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# In Ruby it is the ability to handle exceptional conditions in a manner which:
# 1. Does not cause the application to crash.
# 2. Allows the programmer to log error messages in order to be able to debug the application with details
#    regarding the exception (via the stack trace info).
