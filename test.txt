This is a test text file. Working with git.

How to add and commit files with changes to your local repo, and then push those changes to the remote (origin) repo:
1: git add file_name
2: git commit -m "Added content to the test.txt file to clarify the procedures to be used with git"
# The changes have now been commited to the local repo.
3. Push the local changes up to the remote (origin) repo: git push -u origin master (master = master branch).

How to check if your local repo is up to date?
# Added online on the origin repo's master branch.
1. use git fetch to get the change data from the remote (origin) repo.
2. Use git diff -> git diff master origin/master (master refers to the 'master branch' here).
2. Then use 'git pull' or 'git pull origin master' if needed.
