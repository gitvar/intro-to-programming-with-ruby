1: git add file_name
2: git commit -m "Added content to the test.txt file to clarify the procedures to be used with git"
# The changes have now been commited to the local repo.
3. Push the local changes up to the remote (origin) repo: git push -u origin master

That's it!  

But how to check if your local repo is up to date? Because then you need to do a git pull operation.

# Added online on the origin repo's master branch.
