# Question: Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.
# Answer:
# I was unsure as to what you meant by the question. At first I thought you meant API sources for new Ruby classes or methods
# as produced by the Ruby community or other organisations who might be selling extra Ruby functionality via their code modules.
#
# Watching the Video Walkthrough I realise you mean 'Ruby documentation describing the Ruby Classes and Methods' when you say 
# Ruby 'API sources'.
# I only really have seen the information at www.ruby-doc.org at this stage, but will look at other sources as well.
